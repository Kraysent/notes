- Ability to tag notes
- Search by note name
- Search by tag (simple "contains")
- Search by content
- Support for images (only images that are necessary for the files should be there, also they should not be visible in the list of notes)
- Refresh list of notes when adding or updating title of a note
- Collapse list of notes (by default)
- Move notes to trash and clean up trashed notes
- Button for adding new note
- Do not save on every keystroke, just every 0.5 sec
- Ability to resize sidebar
- Proper sidebar pagination
- Hotkey for switching between notes

Editor:
- Disable suggestions in the editor

Markdown things:

- comments
- syntax highlighting for different notes
- code copy button
- diagrams? mermaid/drawio and stuff, ideally - inline
- proper dots for enumerations
- anchors in the html
- clickable checklist items

More distant things to maybe design:

- offline notes?? maybe not needed
- more friendliness for mobile devices
- tabs? maybe force using search, though feels sketchy
- export as PDF
- export as raw markdown
- more complex rules for searching by title/tags/content/dates
- deduplication of note titles - maybe something similar to filesystem/note namespaces
- UI/UX
- note templates/copying with custom templating (jinja?)
- ai generation/refinement
